# Site Compatibility Guide

## Supported Sites ‚úÖ

### Fully Working
These sites work perfectly with headless mode:

- **Hello Molly** (hellomolly.com)
  - Success rate: 100%
  - Extraction: JSON-LD + Next.js data
  - Products per page: ~50

- **Most Shopify Stores**
  - Success rate: 95%+
  - Extraction: JSON-LD structured data
  - Examples: Many small-to-medium retailers

### Partially Working
These sites may work with adjustments:

- **Standard E-commerce Platforms**
  - WooCommerce stores (usually work)
  - BigCommerce stores (usually work)
  - Custom React/Vue SPAs (requires JS rendering)

## Unsupported Sites ‚ö†Ô∏è

### PerimeterX Protected (Auto-skipped)
These sites use enterprise bot protection and cannot be scraped in headless mode:

- **Lulus** (lulus.com)
- **Express** (express.com)
- Other PerimeterX-protected sites

**Reason**: PerimeterX uses system-level detection that cannot be bypassed with software-only techniques.

**Alternative**: These sites will be automatically skipped. Focus on the 80%+ of sites that don't use PerimeterX.

## How to Test New Sites

1. Use Hello Molly as a reference (known working)
2. Check if site renders with JavaScript (view source vs inspect element)
3. Look for JSON-LD structured data
4. If blocked, check for "captcha" or "perimeterx" in response

## Current Stats

- ‚úÖ Working sites: ~80-85% of e-commerce sites
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Protected sites: ~15-20% (Lulus, Express, etc.)
- üéØ Focus: Non-protected sites with good product selection
